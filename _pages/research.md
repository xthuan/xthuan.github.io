## Research Interests

Our research focus is centered around innovative energy-efficient solutions for future wireless technologies with ultra-low energy requirements. We aim to reduce the energy consumption of future wireless technologies thereby prolong the deployment life of the current and future IoT systems. Note that, the solutions we provided so far and in the future are and will be practical solutions which evaluated on state-of-the-art testbeds and equipment. In particular, we have been working in the following areas:

## Energy-efficient Time Synchronization
* Per-hop delay compensation in time synchronization for multi-hop wireless sensor networks based on packet-relaying gateways
* A beaconless asymmetric energy-efficient time synchronization scheme for resource-constrained multi-Hop wireless sensor networks
* On the practical implementation of propagation delay and clock skew compensated high-precision time synchronization schemes with resource-constrained sensor nodes in multi-hop wireless sensor networks
* Optimal message bundling with delay and synchronization constraints in wireless sensor networks

## Link Quality Maintenance
* An approach to detect anomalous degradation in signal strength of IEEE 802.15.4 links

## Indoor Localization
* Through the ongoing neural network assisted indoor localization project (see project page), we are currently working on the potential AI indoor localization solutions.
* XJTLUIndoorLoc: A new fingerprinting database for indoor localization and trajectory estimation based on Wi-Fi RSS and geomagnetic field
