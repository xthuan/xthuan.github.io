## Research Interests

In 2012, when I was with University Duisburg-Essen, Germany, I started to work on the research for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). From 2012-2017, my research centered around the link quality of WSNs. From 2018, the year I started to pursue my Ph.D. at Unversity of Liverpool & XJTLU, my research still concentrated on WSN; the focus, however, was shifted to time synchronization. Three years later, I foray into the security area; one starting point is the node identification against Spoofing attack. I list my major research below. Note that, the proposed solutions are practical solutions that are all evaluated on a real WSN testbed.

## Energy-efficient Time Synchronization
* Improving multi-hop time synchronization performance in wireless sensor networks based on packet- relaying gateways with per-hop delay compensation
* Per-hop delay compensation in time synchronization for multi-hop wireless sensor networks based on packet-relaying gateways
* A beaconless asymmetric energy-efficient time synchronization scheme for resource-constrained multi-Hop wireless sensor networks
* On the practical implementation of propagation delay and clock skew compensated high-precision time synchronization schemes with resource-constrained sensor nodes in multi-hop wireless sensor networks
* Optimal message bundling with delay and synchronization constraints in wireless sensor networks

## Node Identification against Spoofing Attack
* NISA: Node identification and spoofing attack detection based on clock features and radio information for wireless sensor networks

## Link Quality Maintenance
* An approach to detect anomalous degradation in signal strength of IEEE 802.15.4 links
